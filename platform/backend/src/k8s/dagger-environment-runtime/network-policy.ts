 * (it leaves the pod with the engine pod's IP), so a pod-level egress policy on
 * the engine governs the execs. We therefore apply the *same* egress policy an
 * MCP server in the environment would get, just targeting the engine pod's
 * labels. The provider selection (plain NetworkPolicy / Cilium / GKE FQDN / AWS)
