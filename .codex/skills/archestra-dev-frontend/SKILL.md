# Archestra Frontend Development

Use this skill before changing files under `platform/frontend/` or frontend-facing shared code.

This is the skill for day-to-day platform UI work. For visual design direction on a greenfield, user-facing surface — a marketing or landing page, a generated app, a standalone page — see `design-taste-frontend` instead.

## Commands

Run commands from `platform/` unless specifically instructed otherwise.

```bash
pnpm codegen   # regenerates the OpenAPI spec and the API client
pnpm type-check
pnpm lint
pnpm test
pnpm knip   # flags unused exports; part of frontend check:ci
```

## Data fetching

- Use TanStack Query for data fetching.
- Prefer `useQuery` over `useSuspenseQuery` with explicit loading states.
- Prefer TanStack Query over prop drilling when a component can fetch data by identifier itself.
- Only pass minimal identifiers, such as `catalogId`, needed for child components to fetch or filter their own data.
- TanStack Query caching prevents duplicate requests when multiple components use the same query.

## API clients

- Frontend `.query.ts` files should never call the Archestra backend with `fetch()` directly — use the generated SDK. Raw `fetch()` is only for third-party APIs the SDK does not cover (e.g. GitHub, see `lib/github/*.query.ts`).
- Run `pnpm codegen` first to ensure the generated SDK is up to date (`codegen:api-client` alone only exists inside `@archestra/shared` and needs the env var: `CODEGEN=true pnpm --filter @archestra/shared codegen:api-client` — without `CODEGEN=true` it reads a live `localhost:9000` instead of the committed spec).
- Use generated SDK methods instead of manual API calls for type safety and consistency.
- Reuse API types from `@archestra/shared`, especially `archestraApiTypes` types such as `archestraApiTypes.CreateXxxData["body"]` and `archestraApiTypes.GetXxxResponses["200"]`.
- Do not define duplicate frontend API types when generated/shared types already exist.

## Query error handling

- Handle toasts in `.query.ts` files, not in components.
- Define mutation success/error toasts in `onSuccess` and `onError` callbacks.
- Queries must fail loud: call `throwOnApiError(error)` after the SDK call so the query enters its error state, then keep the existing success return (`return data ?? []`). Swallowing an error into a default makes an outage indistinguishable from a genuinely empty result, which is how an offline app showed "Add an LLM Provider Key".
- `throwOnApiError(error)` toasts via `handleApiError` by default. Screens that render their own error state (e.g. a `QueryLoadError` retry panel gated on `isLoadingError`) pass `{ toastOnError: false }` to avoid a redundant toast and a fresh toast on every retry. Detail endpoints where a 404 means "does not exist" rather than an outage pass `{ allowNotFound: true }` and keep returning their `null` default for that case.
- Mutations keep `handleApiError(error)` + `throw toApiError(error)` in the `mutationFn`.
- Components should not use `try`/`catch` for API calls; API error handling belongs in `.query.ts` files.

## UI components

- Use shadcn/ui components only.
- Add shadcn/ui components with `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`.
- Prefer components from `frontend/src/components/ui` over plain HTML elements when a component exists.
- Use `Button` over raw `<button>`, `Input` over raw `<input>`, and the matching UI component for selects and other controls.
- Keep components small and focused, with extracted business logic where it improves clarity.
- Keep frontend files flat where practical and avoid barrel files.
- Only export what is needed externally.

## Text nodes and machine translation

Chrome page-translate re-parents bare text nodes into `<font>` wrappers. React still holds the original nodes, so deleting one — or inserting an element before it — throws `NotFoundError` and crashes the page (facebook/react#11538, no upstream fix). Never let React add, remove, or replace a **bare** text node: wrap conditional text in an element so only elements move.

`biome-plugins/no-conditional-bare-jsx-text.grit` fails the build on the shapes below, and its diagnostics cannot be suppressed with `biome-ignore` — write them wrapped in the first place:

- `{cond ? <Icon /> : "More"}` → `{cond ? <Icon /> : <span>More</span>}`.
- `{cond ? (<><Loader2 />Loading…</>) : ("Load more")}` → wrap both branches; the fragment's own bare text is deleted when the branch flips, so `<span>Loading…</span>` inside it and `<span>Load more</span>` for the string.
- `{saved && "Saved!"}` → `{saved && <span>Saved!</span>}`.
- `{n > 0 ? " and more" : ""}` → `{n > 0 ? <span> and more</span> : null}` — return `null`, never `""`, and keep the padding spaces inside the span.
- `<Button>{pending ? <Loader2 /> : <Icon />} Save</Button>` → wrap the label: `<span>Save</span>`. Same for a label expression: `<span>{agent ? "Update" : "Create"}</span>`.

The rule cannot see these; apply the convention by hand:

- A `ReactNode` prop or variable rendered next to a conditional sibling (`{icon}{label}`) — wrap it: `{icon}<span>{label}</span>` (`app/messaging-channels/layout.tsx`).
- Loading/empty/data branches whose roots are the **same tag** — React reconciles the element and deletes the bare status text in place. Wrap each branch's text (`<span>Loading tools…</span>`) or give the branches distinct `key`s.
- A shared component rendering a `ReactNode` slot inside an element that persists across content changes — key the wrapper by the content, as `components/form-dialog.tsx` and `components/ui/searchable-select.tsx` do.

Safe, do not churn: text→text updates (`{saving ? "Saving…" : "Save"}`), whole-element unmounts, and strings in attributes.

Wrapping splits a string across sibling elements, so Testing Library's default `getByText` stops matching. Scope to a container with `toHaveTextContent`, or use a function matcher constrained by tag — do not unwrap the span to satisfy a test.

## Forms

- Prefer `useForm` from `react-hook-form` over multiple `useState` hooks for form state.
- Pass form objects to child components as `form: UseFormReturn<FormValues>` rather than passing individual setters.
- Parent components should handle mutations and submission.
- Form components should focus on rendering and validation UI.

## Copy and documentation links

- Do not hardcode `Archestra` in frontend UI copy.
- Use `const appName = useAppName();` and interpolate the app name so white-labeled deployments render correctly.
- Always use `getDocsUrl(DocsPage.PageName, "optional-anchor")` from `@archestra/shared` for documentation links.
- Never hardcode documentation URLs.

## Test mocking

- Frequently-mocked modules have Jest-style `__mocks__` canonical mocks — activate with a bare `vi.mock("<specifier>");` and configure per test via `vi.mocked(...)`. Covered: `@/lib/auth/auth.query`, `@/lib/organization.query`, `@/lib/config/config.query`, `@/lib/teams/team.query`, `@/lib/hooks/use-app-name`, `@/lib/clients/auth/auth-client` (a memoized proxy — every path like `authClient.signIn.email` is a stable `vi.fn()`), plus root-level `__mocks__/` for `next/navigation` and `sonner`.
- Do not write a bespoke partial factory for those specifiers. Exception: a file that partially mocks `@/lib/config/config` may keep factories for the query mocks — the canonical mocks' `importActual` chain eagerly loads `auth-client` → `config/config` and breaks under a partial config mock.
- The `@` alias must stay declared in `vitest.config.ts` `resolve.alias` with an absolute path — tsconfig-paths-only aliasing silently breaks `__mocks__` resolution (vitest-dev/vitest#8343).
