## Overview

Archestra Platform acts as a security proxy between your AI applications and LLM providers. It currently supports the following LLM providers.

## Turning Providers Off

Most organizations only allow a few providers. Go to **Settings → LLM → Model providers** and switch **Available** off for the rest. A turned-off provider disappears from every picker, and the API refuses to configure it.

![Model providers on the LLM settings page](/docs/automated_screenshots/platform-supported-llm-providers_model-providers.webp)

A provider added by a later release arrives switched on.

Keys that already exist keep working, so turning a provider off never breaks live traffic. They are marked as turned off, and you can delete them when you are ready. A retired provider's key can no longer be edited or rotated.

## Personal Subscriptions

Some providers let you sign in with an account you already pay for, instead of buying a metered API key. Go to **Model Providers** and you will see them as cards above the credentials table. Click **Connect** and sign in.

![Personal subscription cards on the Model Providers page](/docs/automated_screenshots/platform-supported-llm-providers_personal-subscriptions.webp)

These credentials are per-user and personal-only. Each person connects their own account, and requests are billed to that subscription. An agent set up with a subscription credential always runs on the chatting user's own subscription — never someone else's. Users without a connected account get a sign-in prompt in chat.

Each provider's section below covers what to turn on with the vendor first.

## Renaming a Provider

Each row also takes a name. It replaces the built-in one everywhere the provider appears — pickers, tables, and the setup copy on the connect page. Leave it empty to keep the name the provider ships with.

Vendor names stay as they are. Rename AWS Bedrock to "Northwind Model Cloud" and its region field still reads "The AWS region to send Northwind Model Cloud requests to", because AWS is the vendor and the region is theirs.

## Model Context and Output Limits

Archestra syncs each model's context window and maximum output tokens from the provider and a public model registry. Self-hosted endpoints and models first seen in proxy traffic often report neither.

You can set both yourself. Go to **LLM → Models**, edit the model, and fill in **Context window** and **Max output tokens** under **Limits**. What you set replaces what the provider reports, and survives the next model refresh. Clear a field to go back to the provider's own number.

The context window sizes the [chat context ring](/docs/platform-chat#context-window-visualizer) and decides when auto-compaction runs. The output limit is what an agent turn asks the provider for. Without one, a turn falls back to a conservative 8192-token budget, which can cut a long answer short.

## OpenAI-Compatible Model Router

The model router exposes one OpenAI-compatible interface for models across configured providers.

### Supported Model Router APIs

- **Responses API** (`/responses`) for text requests across model-router-compatible providers
- **Chat Completions API** (`/chat/completions`) for text chat requests across model-router-compatible providers
- **Models API** (`/models`) for provider-qualified chat and embedding model IDs
- **Embeddings API** (`/embeddings`) for embedding models across supported providers

Embedding models use the same provider-qualified IDs as chat models (for example `openai:text-embedding-3-small` or `gemini:gemini-embedding-001`). Anthropic, Bedrock, Cohere, and GitHub Copilot have no compatible embeddings API through the Model Router and return `501 Not Implemented`. This only concerns the router — [Knowledge](/docs/platform-knowledge#image-embedding) embeds with Bedrock and Cohere through its own clients.

### GitHub Copilot Through the Model Router

GitHub Copilot is routable, with one difference from every other provider: it serves each model over a single API. The router reads which one from the model and sends the request there. Codex and GPT-5.x models go to the Responses API; the rest go to Chat Completions.

Requesting a Responses-only model on `/chat/completions` returns `400 Bad Request` naming the endpoint to use instead.

A Copilot key is tied to one GitHub account, so it is routable only through your own personal virtual key. That key can hold your other providers too, so one router endpoint reaches all of them. See [GitHub Copilot](#github-copilot).

### Model Router Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/model-router`
- **Authentication**: Pass either a mapped virtual API key or an LLM OAuth client access token in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <key>`. Use virtual keys for generic LLM clients and OAuth client access tokens for backend services that can perform OAuth client credentials. See [Authentication](/docs/platform-llm-proxy-authentication).

### List Models

Call `GET /v1/model-router/models` to list OpenAI-compatible model objects. Model IDs are returned as `<provider>:<model-id>` and only include providers mapped to the virtual key or LLM OAuth client used for the request. The list includes chat models and embedding models. Models [restricted to teams](/docs/platform-access-control#team-restricted-models) are omitted unless the request is attributed to a user in one of those teams. See [Authentication](/docs/platform-llm-proxy-authentication) for configuration details.

### Model Resolution

Use provider-qualified model IDs from `/models` for deterministic routing, for example `openai:gpt-5.4`, `anthropic:claude-opus-4-6-20250918`, `groq:llama-3.1-8b-instant`, or `bedrock:amazon.nova-pro-v1:0`.

The prefix before `:` is the provider. The value after `:` is the provider's native model ID, so provider model IDs can still contain slashes or colons.

The `/models` response includes model-router-compatible text models for the providers mapped on the virtual key. Providers that use native request formats, including Anthropic, Bedrock, Gemini, and Cohere, are translated between OpenAI request/response formats and provider-native formats before forwarding.

Model Router translation forwards inline non-text content where the provider's native format supports it: Gemini (base64 data URL images, audio, and files), Anthropic (base64 data URL images and PDF files, plus http(s) image URLs), Cohere (images via base64 data URI or web URL in user messages), and Bedrock (base64 data URL images). Anthropic also forwards images returned inside tool results. Content the provider format cannot represent is dropped — for example http(s) image URLs to Gemini (its `fileData` accepts only Files API or `gs://` URIs), audio to Anthropic, and non-text content in Gemini and Cohere tool results.

## OpenAI

### Supported OpenAI APIs

- **Chat Completions API** (`/chat/completions`)
- **Responses API** (`/responses`)
- **Embeddings API** (`/embeddings`)

### OpenAI Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/openai`
- **Authentication**: Pass your OpenAI API key in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <your-api-key>`

### Important Notes

- **Use Responses API for new clients**: OpenAI recommends `/responses` for new integrations. Chat Completions remains supported for existing clients.
- **Streaming**: OpenAI streaming responses require your cloud provider's load balancer to support long-lived connections. See [Cloud Provider Configuration](/docs/platform-deployment#cloud-provider-configuration-streaming-timeout-settings) for more details.

### ChatGPT Subscription (Codex)

Reuse a ChatGPT/Codex subscription for chat instead of a metered API key. Click **Connect** on the **ChatGPT** card on **Model Providers**, then sign in with the account that holds your subscription.

First turn on device code authorization for the account, in ChatGPT → Settings → Security → **Enable device code authorization for Codex**. It is off by default, and ChatGPT blocks the approval step until you enable it.

See [Personal Subscriptions](#personal-subscriptions) for how these credentials are scoped.

## Anthropic

### Supported Anthropic APIs

- **Messages API** (`/messages`)

### Anthropic Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/anthropic`
- **Authentication**: Pass your Anthropic API key in the `x-api-key` header
- **Messages path**: `POST /v1/anthropic/v1/messages`

### Anthropic on Microsoft Foundry

Claude models deployed in Microsoft Foundry use the Anthropic Messages API at `https://<resource>.services.ai.azure.com/anthropic`. Set `ARCHESTRA_ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` to that `/anthropic` base URL. For keyless Microsoft Entra ID authentication, also set `ARCHESTRA_ANTHROPIC_AZURE_FOUNDRY_ENTRA_ID_ENABLED=true`; Archestra sends a bearer token scoped to `https://ai.azure.com/.default`.

Claude Foundry deployments must exist in Azure before requests will work. Use the deployed Claude model name in the Anthropic `model` field. Microsoft lists extra Claude prerequisites: a paid eligible Azure subscription, a supported region such as East US2 or Sweden Central, Azure Marketplace access for partner models, permission to subscribe to model offerings, and Contributor or Owner role on the resource group.

Azure requires Anthropic deployment metadata when creating Claude deployments: `industry`, `organizationName`, and `countryCode`. In Azure CLI this may require an ARM REST deployment call with `properties.modelProviderData`.

See Microsoft's [Claude on Foundry guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/how-to/use-foundry-models-claude) for the Azure endpoint and authentication details.

### Workload Identity Federation (keyless)

Archestra can authenticate to the Anthropic API without a static API key using [Workload Identity Federation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/manage-claude/workload-identity-federation): it exchanges a short-lived OIDC identity token from your identity provider (Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, Entra ID, GitHub Actions, and others) for an Anthropic access token and sends it as `Authorization: Bearer` upstream. Tokens are cached and refreshed automatically before expiry.

Configure a federation issuer, service account, and federation rule in the Claude Console (**Settings → Workload identity**), then set the `ARCHESTRA_ANTHROPIC_*` WIF environment variables — see [Environment Variables](/docs/platform-deployment#environment-variables) in the deployment docs. When configured, Archestra creates an "Anthropic Workload Identity Federation" system key automatically and syncs the available Claude models; users can also create Anthropic provider keys without entering an API key.

Note: the SDK-standard `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variables take precedence over federation if present in the backend environment, matching Anthropic's documented credential precedence.

## Google Gemini

Archestra supports both the [Google AI Studio](https://ai.google.dev/) (Gemini Developer API) and [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) implementations of the Gemini API.

### Supported Gemini APIs

- **Generate Content API** (`:generateContent`)
- **Stream Generate Content API** (`:streamGenerateContent`)
- **Embeddings API** (`/embeddings`) - OpenAI-compatible

### Gemini Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/gemini/v1beta`
- **Authentication**:
  - **Google AI Studio (default)**: Pass your Gemini API key in the `x-goog-api-key` header
  - **Vertex AI**: No API key required from clients - uses server-side [Application Default Credentials (ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials)

### Using Vertex AI

To use Vertex AI instead of Google AI Studio, configure these environment variables:

| Variable                                      | Required | Description                            |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `ARCHESTRA_GEMINI_VERTEX_AI_ENABLED`          | Yes      | Set to `true` to enable Vertex AI mode |
| `ARCHESTRA_GEMINI_VERTEX_AI_PROJECT`          | Yes      | Your GCP project ID                    |
| `ARCHESTRA_GEMINI_VERTEX_AI_LOCATION`         | No       | GCP region (default: `us-central1`)    |
| `ARCHESTRA_GEMINI_VERTEX_AI_CREDENTIALS_FILE` | No       | Path to service account JSON key file  |

Vertex AI mode also gives Knowledge access to Vertex's multimodal embedding model (`multimodalembedding@001`) — see [Image Embedding](/docs/platform-knowledge#image-embedding).

#### GKE with Workload Identity (Recommended)

For GKE deployments, we recommend using [Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) which provides secure, keyless authentication. This eliminates the need for service account JSON key files.

**Setup steps:**

1. **Create a GCP service account** with Vertex AI permissions:

    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts create archestra-vertex-ai \
      --display-name="Archestra Vertex AI"

    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding PROJECT_ID \
      --member="serviceAccount:archestra-vertex-ai@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
      --role="roles/aiplatform.user"
    ```

2. **Bind the GCP service account to the Kubernetes service account**:

    ```bash
    gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding \
      archestra-vertex-ai@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
      --role="roles/iam.workloadIdentityUser" \
      --member="serviceAccount:PROJECT_ID.svc.id.goog[NAMESPACE/KSA_NAME]"
    ```

    Replace `NAMESPACE` with your Helm release namespace and `KSA_NAME` with the Kubernetes service account name (defaults to `archestra-platform`).

3. **Configure Helm values** to annotate the service account:

```yaml
archestra:
  orchestrator:
    kubernetes:
      serviceAccount:
        annotations:
          iam.gke.io/gcp-service-account: archestra-vertex-ai@PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com
  env:
    ARCHESTRA_GEMINI_VERTEX_AI_ENABLED: "true"
    ARCHESTRA_GEMINI_VERTEX_AI_PROJECT: "PROJECT_ID"
    ARCHESTRA_GEMINI_VERTEX_AI_LOCATION: "us-central1"
```

With this configuration, Application Default Credentials (ADC) will automatically use the bound GCP service account—no credentials file needed.

#### Other Environments

For non-GKE environments, Vertex AI supports several authentication methods through [Application Default Credentials (ADC)](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials):

- **Service account key file**: Set `ARCHESTRA_GEMINI_VERTEX_AI_CREDENTIALS_FILE` to the path of a service account JSON key file
- **Local development**: Use `gcloud auth application-default login` to authenticate with your user account
- **Cloud environments**: Attached service accounts on Compute Engine, Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions are automatically detected
- **AWS/Azure**: Use workload identity federation to authenticate without service account keys

See the [Vertex AI authentication guide](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/authentication) for detailed setup instructions for each environment.

## Groq

[Groq](https://groq.com/) provides low-latency inference for popular open-source models through an OpenAI-compatible API.

### Supported Groq APIs

- **Chat Completions API** (`/chat/completions`) - OpenAI-compatible

### Groq Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/groq`
- **Authentication**: Pass your Groq API key in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <your-api-key>`

### Environment Variables

| Variable                      | Required | Description                                                              |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ARCHESTRA_GROQ_BASE_URL`     | No       | Groq API base URL (default: `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`)            |
| `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_GROQ_API_KEY` | No       | Default API key for Groq (can be overridden per conversation/team/org)   |

### Getting an API Key

### Popular Models

- `llama-3.3-70b-versatile`
- `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
- `gemma2-9b-it`

### Important Notes

- **OpenAI-compatible API**: Groq uses the OpenAI Chat Completions request/response format, which makes it a good fit for existing OpenAI client libraries.
- **Base URL includes `/openai/v1`**: When configuring a custom Groq endpoint, ensure the base URL points to the OpenAI-compatible API root (for example, `https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`).

## OpenRouter

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) provides access to many models - including **free** ones - via a single OpenAI-compatible API, with optional attribution headers for ranking and analytics.

### Supported OpenRouter APIs

- **Chat Completions API** (`/chat/completions`) - OpenAI-compatible
- **Embeddings API** (`/embeddings`) for Knowledge Base embeddings

### OpenRouter Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/openrouter`
- **Authentication**: Pass your OpenRouter API key in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <your-api-key>`

### Environment Variables

| Variable                           | Required | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ARCHESTRA_OPENROUTER_BASE_URL`    | No       | OpenRouter API base URL (default: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`)           |
| `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_OPENROUTER_API_KEY`| No       | Default API key for OpenRouter (can be overridden per conversation/team/org)|
| `ARCHESTRA_OPENROUTER_REFERER`     | No       | Attribution header `HTTP-Referer` sent to OpenRouter (default: `https://archestra.ai`) |
| `ARCHESTRA_OPENROUTER_TITLE`       | No       | App name sent to OpenRouter as `X-OpenRouter-Title` (recommended)           |
| `ARCHESTRA_OPENROUTER_CATEGORIES`  | No       | Comma-separated OpenRouter marketplace categories sent as `X-OpenRouter-Categories` (default: `general-chat,personal-agent`) |

### Getting an API Key

You can generate an API key from the [OpenRouter dashboard](https://openrouter.ai/keys).

### Popular Models

- `openrouter/auto` - OpenRouter's Auto Router; picks the best model per request, billed at that model's rate.
- `openrouter/free` - OpenRouter's Free Models Router; see below.
- `~`-prefixed ids such as `~anthropic/claude-sonnet-latest` are OpenRouter "latest" aliases that always redirect to the newest model in a family. They sync and behave like ordinary models, and are shown with a "Latest" badge in the picker.

### Free Models

OpenRouter exposes `:free` model variants that cost nothing. An OpenRouter API key is still required to use them, but OpenRouter doesn't charge for requests that route to free models. Model providers may use the data from free model requests to improve their models, so it may be not suitable for sensitive data.

**Free Models Router** (`openrouter/free`) is OpenRouter's [built-in router](https://openrouter.ai/openrouter/free) that picks a free model per request, filtering for the features the request needs (tool calling, structured outputs, image input).

When an OpenRouter key is added to an organization that has no default model configured, Archestra sets the Free Models Router as the organization default, giving a zero-cost starting point. An explicitly chosen default is never overridden.

Dynamic-pricing routers (`openrouter/auto`) report no fixed per-token price, so the pricing is dynamic.

Models that generate audio or images also report a zero per-token price, because they bill per second or per image instead. Archestra doesn't mark those free — the "Free models only" filter leaves them out.

## Mistral AI

[Mistral AI](https://mistral.ai/) provides open and commercial AI models through an OpenAI-compatible API.

### Supported Mistral APIs

- **Chat Completions API** (`/chat/completions`)
- **Embeddings API** (`/embeddings`)

### Mistral Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/mistral`
- **Authentication**: Pass your Mistral API key in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <your-api-key>`

### Getting an API Key

You can get an API key from the [Mistral AI Console](https://console.mistral.ai/api-keys).

## Perplexity AI

[Perplexity AI](https://www.perplexity.ai/) provides AI-powered search and answer engines with real-time web search capabilities through an OpenAI-compatible API.

### Supported Perplexity APIs

- **Chat Completions API** (`/chat/completions`) — the `sonar` model family
- **Agent API** (`/responses`) — vendor-prefixed models such as `anthropic/claude-opus-5` and `perplexity/glm-5.2`

One API key works for both. The model you pick selects the API.

### Perplexity Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/perplexity`
- **Authentication**: Pass your Perplexity API key in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <your-api-key>`

### Environment Variables

| Variable                            | Required | Description                                                                    |
| ----------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ARCHESTRA_PERPLEXITY_BASE_URL`     | No       | Perplexity API base URL (default: `https://api.perplexity.ai`)                 |
| `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_PERPLEXITY_API_KEY` | No       | Default API key for Perplexity (can be overridden per conversation/team/org)   |

### Getting an API Key

You can get an API key from the [Perplexity Settings](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api).

### Important Notes

- **Tool calling is per model**: The `sonar` models take no external tools. They perform internal web searches and return the results. The Agent API models accept tools, so agents can run their usual workflows on them.
- **Search results**: `sonar` responses may include `search_results` and `citations` fields containing web search results used to generate the answer.
- **Models**: Popular models include `sonar-pro` and `sonar-deep-research` for search, and `anthropic/claude-opus-5` for tool-using agents.

## OpenAI-Compatible Servers

Any server that speaks the OpenAI `/v1` API connects through this provider. That covers [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm), llama.cpp, LM Studio, SGLang, TGI, and LocalAI. Use it for self-hosted deployments to run open-source models on your own infrastructure.

The provider is listed as **OpenAI-compatible**, and the picker's search finds it by the name of the server you run — type "LM Studio" and it comes up. Its id stays `vllm`, so existing keys, proxy routes, and environment variables are unchanged.

### Supported APIs

- **Chat Completions API** (`/chat/completions`)
- **Embeddings API** (`/embeddings`)

### Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/vllm`
- **Authentication**: API key is **optional**. Pass it in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <your-api-key>` if your server requires auth.

### Setup

1. Go to **Model Providers** and add a new key with provider **OpenAI-compatible**
2. Set the **Base URL** to your server (e.g., `http://your-host:8000/v1`)
3. API key can be left blank for most self-hosted deployments

Every model the server lists is added, so one entry covers a server that hosts several models — a router in front of a fleet, for example.

The base URL can also be set globally via the `ARCHESTRA_VLLM_BASE_URL` environment variable. Per-key base URLs in the UI take precedence.

### Serving Several Models

`vllm serve` runs one model per process. Hosting a second model means running a second server on its own URL. llama.cpp and LM Studio work the same way.

Add each server as its own entry. The models from every server appear together under the provider, and each request goes to the server that hosts the chosen model — so an agent pinned to one server still runs a model that lives on another.

### Environment Variables

| Variable                      | Required | Description                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ARCHESTRA_VLLM_BASE_URL`     | Yes      | Server base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/v1`)                      |
| `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_VLLM_API_KEY` | No       | API key for the server (optional, many deployments don't require auth)  |

### Important Notes

- **Configure base URL to enable the provider**: It is only available when `ARCHESTRA_VLLM_BASE_URL` is set or a per-key base URL is configured in the UI. Without either, it won't appear as an option.
- **Auto-seeding needs the base URL**: Setting `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_VLLM_API_KEY` alone does not create a key at startup. `ARCHESTRA_VLLM_BASE_URL` must also be set, otherwise the provider is skipped (a key without a base URL would silently route to the public OpenAI endpoint).
- **No API key required for most deployments**: Unlike cloud providers, a self-hosted server typically doesn't require authentication. When adding a key in the platform, the API key field is marked as optional.

## Ollama

[Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) is a local LLM runner for open-source large language models on your machine. Use it for local development, testing, and privacy-conscious deployments.

Ollama serves two APIs, and Archestra has a transport for each. Pick the transport when you add the key:

- **Native** — Ollama's own `/api/chat` endpoint. Use it to control Ollama's generation parameters — `num_ctx`, `num_predict`, `top_k`, `repeat_penalty`, thinking, and the rest. The `/v1` endpoint silently drops those options.
- **OpenAI-compatible** — Ollama's `/v1` endpoint. The simplest choice for standard chat, and the only transport with embeddings support.

Both transports talk to the same Ollama server. You can add either or both.

### Supported Ollama APIs

- **Chat API** (`/api/chat`) - Native transport. Discovery endpoints (`/api/tags`, `/api/show`, `/api/ps`) are proxied through unmodified.
- **Chat Completions API** (`/chat/completions`) - OpenAI-compatible transport
- **Embeddings API** (`/embeddings`) - OpenAI-compatible transport only

### Ollama Connection Details

- **Base URL (Native)**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/ollama-native`
- **Base URL (OpenAI-compatible)**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/ollama`
- **Authentication**: API key is **optional**. Pass it in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <your-api-key>` if your Ollama deployment requires auth (e.g., Ollama Cloud).

### Setup

1. Go to **Model Providers** and add a new key with provider **Ollama**
2. Choose a **Transport**: **Native** (the default) or **OpenAI-compatible**
3. Optionally set the **Base URL** if your Ollama server runs on a non-default host/port
4. Leave the API key blank for self-hosted Ollama

Add one entry per Ollama server. Each request goes to the server that has the chosen model pulled.

### Model Parameters

Open **LLM → Models**, edit a native-transport model, and set any generation parameter (`num_ctx`, `num_predict`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `repeat_penalty`, `stop`, thinking) under **Model parameters**. Archestra sends the values you set on every chat turn; leave a field empty to inherit Ollama's own default. The section only appears for the Native transport — `/v1` discards these options.

### Context Window

Ollama often runs a model with a smaller context window than the model architecturally supports. Archestra resolves the effective window — a `num_ctx` configured under [Model Parameters](#model-parameters), else a `num_ctx` baked into the Modelfile, else the model's architectural context length — and displays and enforces it on the Models page and in the [chat context ring](/docs/platform-chat#context-window-visualizer). A window you set under [Limits](#model-context-and-output-limits) is the architectural length for this purpose, so a Modelfile `num_ctx` still caps it.

A server-wide cap set through `OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH` is not reported by Ollama's model API and cannot be detected. If you run a capped server, set `num_ctx` on the model — a request-level value takes precedence.

### Agent Suitability

Ollama reports each model's exact parameter count. Archestra marks a model **Limited for complex tasks** when that count is 8,000,000,000 or lower. The threshold applies to the reported count, not the name — models sold as "8B" usually report slightly more (Llama 3.1 8B reports about 8.03 billion), so they stay unmarked.

The marker shows on the model in the picker. It also shows next to the composer when the agent in that chat brings tools. A 4B model, for example, often calls those tools unreliably over a multi-step task — switch to a larger model for tool-heavy work.

The marker is advice, not a quality verdict. Models are treated as suitable unless something says otherwise, and no provider other than Ollama reports a parameter count today — so no model outside Ollama carries the marker. Each Ollama server is judged separately: the same tag can name different builds on two servers, and each key's marker reflects what its own server reports.

### Environment Variables

| Variable                           | Required | Description                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ARCHESTRA_OLLAMA_BASE_URL`        | No       | OpenAI-compatible transport base URL (default: `http://localhost:11434/v1`)                       |
| `ARCHESTRA_OLLAMA_NATIVE_BASE_URL` | No       | Native transport base URL — the server **root**, with no `/v1` suffix. Defaults to `ARCHESTRA_OLLAMA_BASE_URL` with `/v1` stripped (`http://localhost:11434`) |
| `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_OLLAMA_API_KEY`    | No       | API key for the Ollama server, shared by both transports (optional; use it for the Ollama Cloud API) |

### Important Notes

- **Enabled by default**: both transports point at `http://localhost:11434` out of the box — the OpenAI-compatible one under `/v1`, the native one at the server root.
- **Model availability**: models must be pulled first using `ollama pull <model-name>`.
- **Not available through the model router**: the router has no translation for `/api/chat`, so `ollama-native:` model IDs are not routable. Use the `ollama:` prefix through the router, or call the native base URL directly.
- **Output tokens**: Ollama publishes no output cap, so when a model's output ceiling is unknown the per-turn output budget falls back to the model's context window instead of the 8192-token default. Applies to both transports.
- **Thinking** (Native transport): on or off, not an effort scale. **Inherit** sends nothing and lets Ollama decide. Turning thinking **Off** on a model that reasons anyway can surface its reasoning as the visible answer.
- **Running Archestra in Docker**: when Archestra runs in a container and Ollama runs on the host, `localhost` resolves to the container itself. Use `http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1` (OpenAI-compatible) or `http://host.docker.internal:11434` (Native) as the Base URL instead. The platform detects this case and suggests the change when a `localhost` connection fails.

| `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_XAI_API_KEY` | No       | Default API key for xAI (can be overridden per conversation/team/org)       |

### Getting an API Key

You can generate an API key from the [xAI Console](https://console.x.ai/).

### X Premium (SuperGrok) Subscription

Reuse an X Premium (SuperGrok) subscription for chat instead of a metered API key. Click **Connect** on the **X Premium (SuperGrok)** card on **Model Providers**, then sign in with the X account that holds your subscription.

See [Personal Subscriptions](#personal-subscriptions) for how these credentials are scoped.

The model list and inference requests use xAI's dedicated Grok CLI session proxy, not the metered `api.x.ai` API-key surface. Session requests carry the account identity returned by the device login.

Subscription keys only talk to the configured xAI subscription endpoint. A [per-key base URL override](/docs/platform-llm-proxy-authentication#custom-base-urls) is rejected.

Subscription sign-in is unavailable when Bring Your Own Secrets uses a read-only external Vault, because Archestra cannot save or rotate OAuth credentials there. Use a Vault-backed xAI API key instead, or switch to managed secret storage.

### Popular Models

- `grok-2-latest` - Latest Grok model with enhanced capabilities
- `grok-2-mini` - Lightweight variant optimized for speed
- `grok-beta` - Beta version with experimental features

### Important Notes

- **OpenAI-compatible API**: xAI's API follows the OpenAI Chat Completions format, making it easy to switch between providers
- **Real-time information**: Grok models have access to real-time information from X (Twitter) for up-to-date responses

### Getting an API Key

Obtain your API key from the [Moonshot AI Platform](https://platform.moonshot.ai/console/api-keys).

### Popular Models

- `kimi-k2-0711-preview` - Kimi K2 flagship model with strong reasoning and tool use
- `kimi-latest` - Rolling alias tracking the newest Kimi model
- `moonshot-v1-128k` - Long-context (128K) model

### Important Notes

- **OpenAI-compatible API**: Kimi's API follows the OpenAI Chat Completions format, making it easy to switch between providers
- **/models endpoint**: Kimi exposes a models listing API, so available models are synced automatically from your account
- **International endpoint**: The default base URL uses Moonshot's international endpoint (`api.moonshot.ai`); the China endpoint (`api.moonshot.cn`) can be set via `ARCHESTRA_KIMI_BASE_URL`

## GitHub Copilot

[GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) exposes the models included with a user's Copilot subscription (GPT, Claude, Gemini, and others, depending on plan) through an OpenAI-compatible API. Unlike other providers, Copilot has no static API keys: access is tied to an individual GitHub account.

### Supported GitHub Copilot APIs

- **Chat Completions API** (`/chat/completions`) - OpenAI-compatible
- **Responses API** (`/responses`) - OpenAI-compatible
- **Models API** (`/models`) - lists the models the account can use

Copilot serves each model over one of the two generative APIs. The Codex and GPT-5.x models are served over the Responses API only; the rest are served over Chat Completions only. Calling a model on the wrong API returns an error, so pick the API that matches the model.

The Models API tells you which one to use. Each entry lists its API in `supported_endpoints`.

### GitHub Copilot Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/github-copilot`
- **Authentication**: Pass your **GitHub OAuth token** (the credential below) in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`

Copilot models are also reachable through the model router as `github-copilot:<model-id>`. See [GitHub Copilot Through the Model Router](#github-copilot-through-the-model-router).

### Authentication

A GitHub Copilot provider key stores a **long-lived GitHub OAuth token** (`gho_`/`ghu_…`) for an account with an active Copilot subscription — not a Copilot API key, which does not exist. Archestra exchanges that token for a short-lived Copilot bearer on every request (cached and refreshed automatically), so clients only ever present the GitHub token.

Obtain the token in either way:

- **Sign in with GitHub**: click **Connect** on the **GitHub Copilot** card on **Model Providers**. It runs GitHub's OAuth device flow — you approve a one-time code at `github.com/login/device`, and Archestra stores the resulting token.
- **Reuse an existing token**: the official Copilot CLI / VS Code store one in `~/.config/github-copilot/apps.json` (the `oauth_token` value); paste it into the API key field. The `/connection` setup script for the Copilot CLI reuses or obtains this token automatically.

### Environment Variables

| Variable                                       | Required | Description                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_GITHUB_COPILOT_API_KEY`        | No       | Default GitHub OAuth token for Copilot (can be overridden per conversation/team/org)              |
| `ARCHESTRA_GITHUB_COPILOT_BASE_URL`            | No       | Copilot API base URL (default: `https://api.githubcopilot.com`; GHE: `https://copilot-api.<domain>`) |
| `ARCHESTRA_GITHUB_COPILOT_TOKEN_EXCHANGE_URL`  | No       | GitHub token-exchange endpoint (default: `https://api.github.com/copilot_internal/v2/token`)      |
| `ARCHESTRA_GITHUB_COPILOT_DEVICE_AUTH_BASE_URL`| No       | Host for the device-flow sign-in (default: `https://github.com`)                                  |
| `ARCHESTRA_GITHUB_COPILOT_CLIENT_ID`           | No       | GitHub App client id for the device flow (default: the standard VS Code client id)                |

### Important Notes

- **No static API keys**: access is per-user via a GitHub OAuth token; model availability follows that account's Copilot subscription tier.
- **Per-user only**: because the token is tied to one GitHub account, Copilot keys are **personal scope only** — they can't be shared via team/org scope or wrapped in a team- or org-scoped virtual key. Each user connects their own account. Your own personal virtual key may map Copilot alongside other providers, which is what makes it routable through the model router. When someone uses an agent with a Copilot model but hasn't connected yet, Archestra resolves *their* key (never the agent owner's) and prompts them to connect: an inline "Connect GitHub Copilot" card in chat, or a message with a Settings link in Slack/Teams. Email and scheduled runs fail with an actionable message.
- **Generative models only**: the `/models` listing covers every model reachable through `/chat/completions` or `/responses`. Copilot also serves an Anthropic `/v1/messages` shim and embedding models, which Archestra does not route to.
- **GitHub Enterprise**: point the base, token-exchange, and device-auth URLs at your GHE host. Organizations with their own GitHub App can override the client id.

## Microsoft 365 Copilot

[Microsoft 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot) answers prompts grounded in the user's Microsoft 365 tenant data (mail, SharePoint, Teams) and the web. Archestra connects to it through the [Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/extensibility/api/ai-services/chat/overview) (Microsoft Graph, beta). Like GitHub Copilot, there are no static API keys: access is tied to an individual Microsoft work account with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license.

### Supported Microsoft 365 Copilot APIs

- **Chat API** (`/copilot/conversations/{id}/chat`) - synchronous answers
- **Chat streaming API** (`/copilot/conversations/{id}/chatOverStream`) - streamed answers

Archestra exposes both through its standard OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` proxy surface. Streaming requests (the built-in chat always streams) use `chatOverStream`; non-streaming requests use `chat`. The single model is `microsoft-365-copilot` — the Chat API has no model selection.

### Microsoft 365 Copilot Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/microsoft-365-copilot`
- **Authentication**: Pass the stored **Entra refresh token** (the credential below) in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <token>`

### Prerequisites: Entra App Registration

The sign-in flow needs an [Entra ID app registration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-register-app) owned by your organization:

1. Register an application in the Microsoft Entra admin center. The device flow runs as a public client — skip the client secret and redirect URI.
2. Enable **Allow public client flows** (Authentication → Advanced settings). Without it, sign-in fails after the code is entered.
3. Add these **delegated** Microsoft Graph permissions and grant admin consent: `Sites.Read.All`, `Mail.Read`, `People.Read.All`, `OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All`, `Chat.Read`, `ChannelMessage.Read.All`, `ExternalItem.Read.All`. The Chat API requires all seven — one per data source Copilot searches.
4. Set `ARCHESTRA_MICROSOFT_365_COPILOT_CLIENT_ID` to the Application (client) ID.
5. For a **single-tenant** registration, also set `ARCHESTRA_MICROSOFT_365_COPILOT_TENANT_ID` to your tenant ID. The default (`organizations`) only works for multi-tenant registrations.

With a multi-tenant registration, users from another organization can sign in once their own tenant admin consents to the app.

### Authentication

A Microsoft 365 Copilot provider key stores a **long-lived Entra refresh token** for an account with a Microsoft 365 Copilot license. Archestra redeems it for a short-lived Graph access token on every request (cached and refreshed automatically). Entra rotates refresh tokens; Archestra persists the rotated token back to the key.

To connect, use the **Sign in with Microsoft** button when adding a Microsoft 365 Copilot key. It runs Entra's OAuth device flow — you approve a one-time code on Microsoft's device sign-in page, and Archestra stores the resulting refresh token.

### Environment Variables

| Variable                                    | Required | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ARCHESTRA_MICROSOFT_365_COPILOT_CLIENT_ID`     | Yes      | Application (client) ID of your Entra app registration (sign-in is unavailable without it) |
| `ARCHESTRA_MICROSOFT_365_COPILOT_TENANT_ID`     | No       | Entra tenant of the OAuth endpoints (default: `organizations`; pin your tenant id to restrict sign-in) |
| `ARCHESTRA_MICROSOFT_365_COPILOT_BASE_URL`      | No       | Microsoft Graph base URL (default: `https://graph.microsoft.com/beta`)                   |
| `ARCHESTRA_MICROSOFT_365_COPILOT_AUTH_BASE_URL` | No       | Entra host for device sign-in and token redemption (default: `https://login.microsoftonline.com`) |

### Important Notes

- **Preview API**: the Chat API is a Microsoft Graph **beta** endpoint. Microsoft does not support it for production use and may change it without notice.
- **License required**: each user needs a Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on license, assigned in their own tenant. The seat license covers all Chat API usage. A missing license surfaces on the first chat request.
- **Work accounts only**: the Chat API supports delegated work or school accounts.
- **Per-user only**: keys are **personal scope only**, same as GitHub Copilot. Each user connects their own Microsoft account; an inline "Connect Microsoft 365 Copilot" card appears in chat when a key is missing. Every request runs as the signed-in user — Copilot only sees data that user can already access.
- **Text-only, no tools**: the Chat API returns text answers only. It cannot run tools or Copilot actions such as creating files, sending emails, or scheduling meetings. In Archestra chat, an agent with tools runs without them on this model — a notice above the composer says so. Proxy requests that declare tools are rejected with a clear error.
- **Conversational answers only**: prompts that trigger long-running work can hit Microsoft's gateway timeout. Keep requests to questions and answers.
- **Estimated usage**: the Chat API reports no token counts, so usage and cost figures are tokenizer estimates.
- **Stateless mapping**: each request creates a fresh Copilot conversation; prior turns ride along as context. If a streaming response has no recognizable text, Archestra retries through the synchronous endpoint in a second conversation, so one request can appear as two conversations in Microsoft 365 activity.
- **Conversation cleanup**: the [Copilot conversation API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/copilot/extensibility/api/ai-services/chat/resources/copilotconversation) currently documents no delete operation. If a chat request fails after its conversation is created, the abandoned conversation may remain visible in Microsoft 365 activity.

## Archestra

Use another Archestra instance as an upstream provider. One Archestra routes its traffic through a second Archestra, which applies its own policies before reaching the real model. The upstream's model router is OpenAI-compatible, so this provider follows the OpenAI chat-completions path and can reach every provider that instance has configured.

### Supported Archestra APIs

- **Chat Completions API** (`/chat/completions`) - OpenAI-compatible

### Archestra Connection Details

- **Base URL**: the upstream Archestra's model router, for example `https://your-archestra/v1/model-router`.
- **Authentication**: pass a virtual API key (`arch_...`) minted from that LLM Proxy in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <key>`.

### Setup

1. On the upstream Archestra, create a virtual API key on the **LLM Proxy** page.
2. On this Archestra, go to **Model Providers** and add a new key with provider **Archestra**.
3. Set the **Base URL** to the upstream proxy's model router (for example `https://your-archestra/v1/model-router`).
4. Paste the virtual API key from the upstream LLM Proxy.

Archestra fetches the model list from the upstream's `{base-url}/models` endpoint, so the picker shows exactly the models that proxy exposes. Model IDs are provider-qualified, for example `openai:gpt-5.4`.

### Environment Variables

| Variable                           | Required | Description                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ARCHESTRA_ARCHESTRA_BASE_URL`     | No       | Global upstream base URL. Normally set per key in the UI; a global value only enables raw passthrough at the `/v1/archestra` proxy prefix. |
| `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_ARCHESTRA_API_KEY` | No       | Default virtual API key for the built-in chat feature.                                          |

### Important Notes

- **Base URL is required**: the upstream endpoint has no default, so a per-key base URL is always needed. Without one, the provider cannot resolve an upstream and requests would fall back to the public OpenAI endpoint.
- **Models come from the upstream**: the model list mirrors whatever the upstream LLM Proxy exposes, so it stays in sync as that instance changes.

## Amazon Bedrock

### Supported Bedrock APIs

- **Converse API** (`/converse`) ([AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_Converse.html))
- **Converse Stream API** (`/converse-stream`) ([AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_ConverseStream.html))
- **InvokeModel API** (`/model/{model-id}/invoke` and `/model/{model-id}/invoke-with-response-stream`) for Anthropic models ([AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_runtime_InvokeModel.html)). This is the API the Anthropic SDK's Bedrock client uses — point Claude Code at Archestra with `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1` and `ANTHROPIC_BEDROCK_BASE_URL=http://localhost:9000/v1/bedrock`.
- **OpenAI-compatible API (Mantle)** - ⚠️ Not yet supported ([AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/bedrock-mantle.html))

### Bedrock Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/bedrock`
- **Authentication**: Bearer API key or AWS IAM (see below)

### Region

Each Bedrock key carries an AWS region. Amazon enables models per region, so the region decides which models the key can use — pick the one where your models are turned on.

A key can also point at a custom endpoint instead, for a VPC or PrivateLink setup. Archestra reads the region back out of that endpoint, and falls back to `us-east-1` when the endpoint carries no region.

### Prompt Caching

Bedrock can reuse the unchanging prefix of a request instead of reprocessing it every turn. That prefix is the system prompt, tool definitions, and earlier turns. Reuse needs an explicit cache marker, and who sets it depends on how the request reaches Bedrock:

- Chat conversations are marked automatically. Archestra marks the stable prefix and the most recent turn, so each turn reuses what the one before it wrote. There is no setting to turn that off.
- Every other path forwards the markers its caller set, unchanged. On the LLM Proxy that leaves the decision with your own client — Claude Code, for example, marks its own requests. Agent runs reached over A2A, including the Slack, Teams, and Telegram integrations, set no marker of their own, so they go uncached unless the caller adds one.

Bedrock only caches for Claude and the Nova text models. Other families reject a marked request outright, so Archestra marks none of them. An unfamiliar model forfeits the cache rather than failing.

A cached prefix lives five minutes by default. Archestra asks for the one-hour lifetime on Claude 4.5, the only generation Bedrock accepts it on. Any gap longer than the lifetime expires the prefix, and the next request pays to write all of it again.

Cache tokens are billed differently from ordinary input. Reads cost a tenth of the input price, five-minute writes 1.25x, and one-hour writes 2x. The longer lifetime therefore trades a higher write price for fewer rewrites, and pays off whenever it keeps a prefix alive across a gap that would otherwise have expired it. Archestra estimates with those ratios when a model has no cache prices of its own — see [Costs & Limits](/docs/platform-costs-and-limits#prompt-caching) for setting exact ones and reading cache spend back.

### Authentication Methods

Bedrock supports two authentication methods:

**API Key** (default) — Pass your [Bedrock API key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/api-keys.html) via the UI or `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_BEDROCK_API_KEY` env var.

**AWS IAM** — Use the AWS credential chain (IRSA, instance profiles, environment variables) instead of API keys. When enabled, Archestra authenticates to Bedrock using SigV4 signing. No API key is needed — Bedrock appears as a system-configured provider automatically.

### IAM Authentication Setup (IRSA)

To use IAM authentication on EKS with [IRSA](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html):

1. Create an IAM role with `AmazonBedrockFullAccess` or a scoped policy (see below)
2. Create an [OIDC provider](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/enable-iam-roles-for-service-accounts.html) for your EKS cluster
3. Configure the IAM role's trust policy to allow the Archestra service account:

   ```json
   {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Principal": {
       "Federated": "arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:oidc-provider/oidc.eks.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/id/<OIDC_ID>"
     },
     "Action": "sts:AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity",
     "Condition": {
       "StringEquals": {
         "oidc.eks.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/id/<OIDC_ID>:sub": "system:serviceaccount:archestra:archestra-platform"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. Annotate the Archestra service account:

   ```bash
   kubectl annotate sa archestra-platform -n archestra \
     eks.amazonaws.com/role-arn=arn:aws:iam::<ACCOUNT_ID>:role/<ROLE_NAME>
   ```

5. Set the environment variables below and restart the deployment

#### Minimum IAM Policy

Archestra calls the Bedrock **Converse API**, and the **InvokeModel API** for clients that use it (Claude Code, for example). The IAM role needs these actions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:Converse",
        "bedrock:ConverseStream",
        "bedrock:InvokeModel",
        "bedrock:InvokeModelWithResponseStream"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:bedrock:*:<ACCOUNT_ID>:inference-profile/us.anthropic.*",
        "arn:aws:bedrock:*::foundation-model/anthropic.*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "bedrock:ListInferenceProfiles",
        "bedrock:ListFoundationModels"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

Use `*` for the region in resource ARNs — cross-region inference profiles (`us.` prefix) can route requests to any US region.

The two list actions populate the model picker. `ListInferenceProfiles` returns cross-region and application inference profiles. `ListFoundationModels` adds on-demand models that have no inference profile. Without it, those models are not offered.

### Environment Variables

#### Common (both auth methods)

| Variable                                 | Required | Description                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_BASE_URL`             | No       | Optional custom Bedrock runtime endpoint. Without it, Archestra derives `https://bedrock-runtime.<region>.amazonaws.com` from the selected/configured region. |
| `ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_ALLOWED_PROVIDERS`    | No       | Comma-separated list of provider prefixes to include. When empty (default), all profiles are returned. |
| `ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_ALLOWED_INFERENCE_REGIONS` | No | Comma-separated list of inference region prefixes (e.g., `us,global`). When empty (default), all regions are returned. |

#### API Key auth

| Variable                         | Required | Description                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_BEDROCK_API_KEY` | No       | Default API key for Bedrock (can be overridden per team/org in UI) |

#### IAM auth (IRSA / instance profiles)

| Variable                             | Required | Description                                                              |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_IAM_AUTH_ENABLED` | Yes      | Set to `true` to enable IAM authentication                               |
| `ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_REGION`           | No       | Explicit AWS region. Falls back to extracting from base URL               |

When IAM auth is enabled, Archestra uses the [AWS credential chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdkref/latest/guide/standardized-credentials.html) — IRSA on EKS, EC2 instance profiles, or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`/`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` env vars. No API key is needed.

#### `ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_BASE_URL`

Optional custom endpoint override. Without it, Archestra builds the standard AWS runtime endpoint from the key's selected region, `ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_REGION`, or `us-east-1` when neither is set:

```
https://bedrock-runtime.{region}.amazonaws.com
```

#### Model Discovery

Archestra uses the Bedrock [ListInferenceProfiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/APIReference/API_ListInferenceProfiles.html) API to discover available models. This means only models that have inference profiles configured in your AWS account will appear — ensuring the model picker only shows models you can actually use.

#### Filtering Models by Provider

By default, Archestra returns all active inference profiles from your AWS account. Use `ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_ALLOWED_PROVIDERS` to limit which providers appear in the model picker.

The filter matches the provider segment of the inference profile ID (the part after the region prefix). For example, the profile `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` has provider `anthropic`.

```bash
# Only Anthropic and Amazon models
ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_ALLOWED_PROVIDERS=anthropic,amazon

# Only Anthropic models
ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_ALLOWED_PROVIDERS=anthropic

# All providers (default)
ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_ALLOWED_PROVIDERS=
```

Common provider prefixes: `anthropic`, `amazon`, `meta`, `mistral`, `deepseek`, `cohere`, `writer`, `stability`, `twelvelabs`.

#### Filtering Models by Inference Region

Use `ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_ALLOWED_INFERENCE_REGIONS` to limit which inference
regions appear in the model picker.

The filter matches the region prefix of the inference profile ID (the first
segment before the provider). For example, the profile
`us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6` has region prefix `us`.

```bash
# Only US and global profiles
ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_ALLOWED_INFERENCE_REGIONS=us,global

# Only EU profiles
ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_ALLOWED_INFERENCE_REGIONS=eu

# All regions (default)
ARCHESTRA_BEDROCK_ALLOWED_INFERENCE_REGIONS=
```

Known region prefixes: `us`, `eu`, `ap`, `global`.

## Azure AI Foundry

[Azure AI Foundry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-foundry) (formerly Azure OpenAI) provides access to OpenAI models through Microsoft Azure, with an OpenAI-compatible API.

### Supported Azure AI Foundry APIs

- Chat Completions (streaming and non-streaming)
- Responses API (streaming and non-streaming)
- Embeddings API (`/embeddings`) - OpenAI-compatible

### Azure AI Foundry Connection Details

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:9000/v1/azure`
- **API key authentication**: Pass your Azure API key in the `Authorization` header as `Bearer <your-api-key>`
- **Keyless authentication**: Set `ARCHESTRA_AZURE_OPENAI_ENTRA_ID_ENABLED=true` and assign the workload identity, managed identity, service principal, or local Azure CLI user an Azure role that can invoke the deployed model.

### Azure AI Foundry Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `ARCHESTRA_AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL` | No | Default Azure OpenAI resource URL or Foundry v1 URL. Not required when Azure provider keys are configured in the UI with their own Base URL. |
| `ARCHESTRA_AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` | No | Azure OpenAI API version (default: `2024-02-01`) |
| `ARCHESTRA_AZURE_OPENAI_RESPONSES_API_VERSION` | No | Azure Responses API version (default: `2025-04-01-preview`) |
| `ARCHESTRA_AZURE_OPENAI_ENTRA_ID_ENABLED` | No | Set to `true` to use Microsoft Entra ID instead of an Azure API key |
| `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` | No | Default API key for Azure AI Foundry chat (can be overridden per conversation/team/org) |

Setting `ARCHESTRA_CHAT_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` alone does not create an Azure key at startup; `ARCHESTRA_AZURE_OPENAI_BASE_URL` must also be set (Azure has no usable default endpoint), otherwise the provider is skipped.

### Getting an Azure API Key

You can generate an API key from the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_ProjectOxford/CognitiveServicesHub/~/OpenAI) under your Azure OpenAI resource.

### Keyless Authentication with Microsoft Entra ID

To use Azure OpenAI without storing an API key, set:

```bash
ARCHESTRA_AZURE_OPENAI_ENTRA_ID_ENABLED=true
```

Then create an Azure provider key in Archestra with no API key value and set its Base URL to one of the Azure resource endpoints below.

```bash
https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com/openai
```

For Foundry v1, use:

```bash
https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/openai/v1
```

Archestra uses Azure Identity `DefaultAzureCredential`. Deployment URLs use the `https://cognitiveservices.azure.com/.default` token scope. Foundry v1 URLs use `https://ai.azure.com/.default`. Assign the workload identity, managed identity, service principal, or local Azure CLI user a role that can invoke the Azure resource.

See the [Azure OpenAI keyless example](https://github.com/archestra-ai/examples/tree/main/azure-openai-keyless) for a minimal local script that uses the same authentication flow.
See Microsoft's [Foundry Models Entra ID guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/how-to/configure-entra-id) and [Foundry Models endpoint guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/foundry/foundry-models/concepts/endpoints) for the Azure endpoint formats and token scopes.

#### AKS with Microsoft Entra Workload ID

For AKS deployments, use [Microsoft Entra Workload ID](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview) with a user-assigned managed identity. Microsoft documents that Azure Identity `DefaultAzureCredential` uses the workload identity environment injected into the pod.

Enable OIDC issuer and workload identity on the AKS cluster, create a federated identity credential for the Archestra Kubernetes service account, and grant the managed identity the inference role required by the resource: `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` for Azure OpenAI deployment URLs, or `Cognitive Services User` for Foundry Models. The service account subject must match the namespace and service account name used by the Helm release:

```bash
az aks update \
  --resource-group "$AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --name "$AKS_CLUSTER_NAME" \
  --enable-oidc-issuer \
  --enable-workload-identity

export AKS_OIDC_ISSUER="$(az aks show \
  --resource-group "$AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --name "$AKS_CLUSTER_NAME" \
  --query oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl \
  --output tsv)"

az identity federated-credential create \
  --resource-group "$IDENTITY_RESOURCE_GROUP" \
  --identity-name "$USER_ASSIGNED_IDENTITY_NAME" \
  --name archestra-platform \
  --issuer "$AKS_OIDC_ISSUER" \
  --subject "system:serviceaccount:$NAMESPACE:$SERVICE_ACCOUNT_NAME" \
  --audience api://AzureADTokenExchange
```

Then annotate the Helm service account and add the pod label required by the AKS workload identity webhook:

```yaml
archestra:
  orchestrator:
    kubernetes:
      serviceAccount:
        name: archestra-platform
        annotations:
          azure.workload.identity/client-id: "<user-assigned-managed-identity-client-id>"
  podLabels:
    azure.workload.identity/use: "true"
  env:
    ARCHESTRA_AZURE_OPENAI_ENTRA_ID_ENABLED: "true"
```

See Microsoft's [AKS Workload ID deployment guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/workload-identity-deploy-cluster) for the full cluster, service account, and federated credential setup.

### Base URL Format

For Azure OpenAI resources, use the shared resource-level OpenAI URL:

```
https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com/openai
```

Archestra discovers deployments from `/openai/deployments` and routes each request to the deployment named in the request `model` field.
Do not configure a deployment-specific URL such as `https://<resource-name>.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/<deployment-name>`.
If your Foundry project has its own OpenAI endpoint, use the same resource-level format with the project hostname:

```
https://<project-name>.openai.azure.com/openai
```

For Microsoft Foundry v1, use the OpenAI-compatible API root:

```
https://<resource-name>.services.ai.azure.com/openai/v1
```

The same formats apply when configuring a Base URL in the API key settings UI. Base URL is used for deployment discovery and as the default runtime endpoint.

If deployment discovery and runtime inference use different Azure OpenAI endpoints, set the provider key's optional Inference URL to the runtime endpoint:

```
https://<runtime-resource-name>.openai.azure.com/openai
```

Archestra will still discover deployments from Base URL, then send chat, reranking, embedding, LLM Proxy, OAuth client, and virtual key traffic to Inference URL.

### Deployment Discovery and RBAC

- For Entra ID configurations, Archestra first tries Azure deployment discovery. If the inference endpoint cannot list deployments, Archestra uses Azure management APIs to find the Cognitive Services account and list its deployments.
- Some Foundry project endpoints are backed by a parent Azure AI Services account, for example `/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<account-name>/projects/<project-name>`. Archestra resolves the project to its parent account before listing deployments.
- For Azure OpenAI resource URLs, Archestra does not fall back to the available model catalog because that catalog includes undeployed models.
- For built-in Azure RBAC, assign `Cognitive Services OpenAI User` at the backing Azure AI Services resource when possible. Use the full ARM resource scope, for example `/subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/<resource-name>`. For the narrowest access, use a custom role with `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/read`, `Microsoft.Resources/subscriptions/resources/read`, `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/read`, and `Microsoft.CognitiveServices/accounts/deployments/read`.

### Routing Notes

- **API Version**: Azure OpenAI resource URLs use `ARCHESTRA_AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` for Chat Completions and model discovery. Azure `/responses` requests use `ARCHESTRA_AZURE_OPENAI_RESPONSES_API_VERSION`. Foundry v1 URLs do not use either query parameter.
- **Microsoft Entra ID**: When `ARCHESTRA_AZURE_OPENAI_ENTRA_ID_ENABLED=true`, Azure provider keys can omit the API key value and Archestra sends `Authorization: Bearer <token>` to Azure OpenAI instead of `api-key`.
- **Grok on Azure**: Grok models sold directly by Azure use the Foundry v1 OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions API. The model must be deployed in the Azure resource before Archestra can route to it.
- **Claude on Azure**: Claude models on Microsoft Foundry use Anthropic's Messages API shape, not the OpenAI-compatible Azure route. Configure the Anthropic provider section above.
- **Multiple Deployments**: Azure OpenAI is the main provider that exposes multiple deployment names behind one resource-level credential. One Azure provider key should represent the Azure resource or Foundry v1 endpoint, not an individual deployment. After model sync, select the deployment by model name.
- **Responses API model field**: For Azure `/responses` requests, send the deployment name in the `model` field. Archestra will route the request to Azure's `/openai/responses` endpoint while preserving the configured deployment URL for discovery and management.
- **OpenAI-compatible API**: Azure AI Foundry supports both Chat Completions and Responses-style request flows through Archestra.
